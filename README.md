# Introduction

This project is aimed at helping kids (and parents checking their homeworks) in math operations, calculating them ste-by-step, like if done manually on a paper.
The calculations are carried out as integer, but decimal numbers are dealt with as well.

The operations currently available are:

# Division
For example the division 1345/21 (resulting in 64, with the remainer of 1) will be represented like this:
```
/	-	\	^	 	 	 	 	 	
1	3	4	5	 	:	 	2	1	
 	 	 	 	 	-	-	-	-	-
1	3	4	 	 	|	 	6	4	
1	2	6	 	 	|	 	 	 	
0	0	8	5	 	|	 	 	 	
 	 	8	4	 	|	 	 	 	
 	 	 	1	 	|	 	 	
```

# Multiplication
For example the multiplication 232*98227 (resulting in 22788664) will be represented like this:
```
 	 	 	 	 	2	3	2	 	x
 	 	 	9	8	2	2	7	 	=
-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
 	 	 	 	1	6	2	4
 	 	 	 	4	6	4	0
 	 	 	4	6	4	0	0
 	1	8	5	6	0	0	0
2	0	8	8	0	0	0	0
-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
2	2	7	8	8	6	6	4
```

# Factorization
For example the factorization of 45 (resulting in 3^2 x 5) will be represented like this:
```

4	5	 	=	 	3	^	2	 	x	 	5

 	 	 	 	 	1
 	 	 	 	 	3
 	 	 	 	 	5
 	 	 	 	 	9
 	 	 	 	 	1	5
 	 	 	 	 	4	5
```
